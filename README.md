# Transit Recovery Analysis Post-COVID-19 Pandemic  
This project analyzes how transit systems in the United States have recovered since the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on ridership and profitability across various transit modes. We explore data from the U.S. Department of Transportation covering the years 2018 to 2022, providing insights into the changing dynamics of urban transportation.

## Project Overview  
The COVID-19 pandemic brought significant challenges to American transit, including a steep decline in ridership and financial viability. This report delves into the data to understand the extent of recovery and ongoing challenges faced by transit agencies. We evaluate metrics such as the recovery ratio, passenger miles, and cost per passenger mile across different modes, including buses, heavy rail, and light rail, to provide a comprehensive view of the transit landscape.
  
## Data Sources  
We utilize the transit metrics datasets from the U.S. Department of Transportation for the years 2018 through 2022, focusing on the following key metrics:  
  
Recovery Ratio: Proportion of operating expenses covered by fare revenues.  
Passenger Miles: Total distance ridden by all passengers during the fiscal year.  
Cost per Passenger Mile: Average cost to transport one passenger one mile.
  
## Key Findings  
Ridership Trends: Despite some recovery in 2022, transit ridership has not returned to pre-pandemic levels. A substantial decrease in passenger miles serviced per vehicle indicates underutilization.  
Financial Viability: The decline in fare revenue to operating cost ratio highlights the financial strains on transit agencies.  
Mode Analysis: Different transit modes exhibit varying degrees of recovery, with heavy rail and light rail showing significant declines in ridership, whereas buses displayed a slightly better recovery trajectory.
